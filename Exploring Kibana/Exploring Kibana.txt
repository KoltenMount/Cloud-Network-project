2.

Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
 - time frame located (Dec 23, 2020 @ 15:00:00 -> 18:00:00)

In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
 - a little over 9 kb download, deb file, from ethiopia, middle of the day, and after some research
   I can't find an average size for a deb file, but I did find sizes of average malware files.
   the closest thing I could find was Trojan files. Currently there's not enough info to tell
   if this activity is suspect.

5.

What do you think the user was doing?
 - The user could have been doing any number of things, it looks like he was doing a little research
   on a famous astronaught prior to the downlaod. The URL indicates the download was from a safe
   website, indicated by "HTTPS". The user could have been setting up a VM environment for example. But
   considering it is a deb file it's possible he's using it to inject trojan malware for phising
   purposes, or if the user has somehow gained access to another machine, it could be used to
   inject any form of malware. There is not enough evidence to believe the user is up to nefarious 
   deeds however.

Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
 - I don't believe the file was malicious, it's simply a packet management file for debian

Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
 - Other than a Windows OS downloading a DEB file, not really. But again, it could still be used
   to inject malicious script and infect some other company.

Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
 - From what I inspected and with the help of additional research I could find on web traffic 
   compliance guidlines, nothing I saw was potenially outside of said guidlines.
